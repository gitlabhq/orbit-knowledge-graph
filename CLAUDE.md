## Tooling

Use mise for all tasks.

| Goal | Command |
| --- | --- |
| Build | `mise build` |
| Fast tests | `mise test:fast` |
| Local tests | `mise test:local` |
| Integration tests | `mise test:integration` |
| Server integration tests | `mise test:integration:server` |
| CLI integration tests | `mise test:cli` |
| Check or fix code | `mise lint:code`, `mise lint:code:fix` |
| Check docs | `mise lint:docs` |
| Validate ontology | `mise ontology:validate` |
| Start or dispatch the server | `mise server:start`, `mise server:dispatch` |

`docs-locale/` is generated. Never read, edit, or reference it.

After you create a worktree, run `mise trust`. Then set the shared hooks path:

```shell
git config core.hooksPath "$(git rev-parse --git-common-dir)/hooks"
```

## Where to find things

List these directories and read the relevant owner before you act:

- `docs/design-documents/` for architecture, security, schema, querying, and indexing.
- `docs/dev/` for runbooks, the crate map, and the reference index.
- Before working in a crate, check for and read `crates/<crate>/AGENTS.md`.

Read `CONTRIBUTING.md` for engineering, documentation, and MR conventions. Read
`CONTEXT.md` for domain terms.
